## 👋 Hi, I’m Mili Patel

I’m a Computer Science & Data Science undergraduate at Rutgers University (New Brunswick), graduating May 2026. My work focuses on applying data analysis, machine learning, and automation techniques to real datasets in academic, nonprofit, and startup environments.

My experience spans SQL- and Python-based data pipelines, dashboard development in Tableau and Power BI, and building machine learning models for prediction, segmentation, and optimization. I’m particularly interested in roles where data engineering, analytics, and ML intersect to support decision-making.

I’m currently seeking internship or entry-level opportunities in **Data Analytics, Data Science, or Machine Learning Engineering**.
